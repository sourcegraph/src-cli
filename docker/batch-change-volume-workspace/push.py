# This is a very simple script to build and push the Docker image used by the
# Docker volume workspace driver. It's normally run from the "Publish Docker
# image dependencies" GitHub Action, but can be run locally if necessary.
#
# This script requires Python 3.8 or later, and Docker 19.03 (for buildx). You
# are strongly encouraged to use Black to format this file after modifying it.
#
# To run it locally, you'll need to be logged into Docker Hub, and create an
# image in a namespace that you have access to. For example, if your username is
# "alice", you could build and push the image as follows:
#
# $ ./push.py -d Dockerfile -i alice/src-batch-change-volume-workspace
#
# By default, only the "latest" tag will be built and pushed. The script refers
# to the HEAD ref given to it, either via $GITHUB_REF or the -r argument. If
# this is in the form refs/tags/X.Y.Z, then we'll also push X, X.Y, and X.Y.Z
# tags.
#
# Finally, if you have your environment configured to allow multi-architecture
# builds with docker buildx, you can provide a --platform argument that will be
# passed through verbatim to docker buildx build. (This is how we build ARM64
# builds in our CI.) For example, you could build ARM64 and AMD64 images with:
#
# $ ./push.py --platform linux/arm64,linux/amd64 ...
#
# For this to work, you will need a builder with the relevant platforms enabled.
# More instructions on this can be found at
# https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/#build-multi-platform-images.
