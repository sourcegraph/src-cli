## Development

If you want to develop the CLI, clone the repository and build/install it with `go install`

```
cd src-cli/
go install ./cmd/src
```

## Releasing

1.  If this is a non-patch release, update the changelog. Add a new section `## $MAJOR.MINOR` to [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#unreleased) immediately under `## Unreleased changes`. Add new empty `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, and `Removed` sections under `## Unreleased changes`.
2.  Find the latest version (either via the releases tab on GitHub or via git tags) to determine which version you are releasing.
3.  `VERSION=9.9.9 ./release.sh` (replace `9.9.9` with the version you are releasing)
4.  GitHub will automatically perform the release via the [goreleaser action](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli/actions?query=workflow%3AGoreleaser). Once it has finished, **you need to confirm**:
    1. The [curl commands in the README](README.markdown#installation) fetch the latest version above.
    2. The [releases section of the repo sidebar](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli) shows the correct version.
5.  Make the necessary updates to the main Sourcegraph repo:
    1. Update the `MinimumVersion` constant in the [src-cli package](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/tree/main/internal/src-cli/consts.go).
    2. Update the reference documentation by running `go generate ./doc/cli/references`.
    3. Commit the changes, and open a PR.

### Patch releases

If a backwards-compatible change is made _after_ a backwards-incompatible one, the backwards-compatible one should be re-released to older instances that support it.

A Sourcegraph instance returns the highest patch version with the same major and minor version as `MinimumVersion` as defined in the instance. Patch versions are reserved solely for non-breaking changes and minor bug fixes. This allows us to dynamically release fixes for older versions of `src-cli` without having to update the instance.

To release a bug fix or a new feature that is backwards compatible with one of the previous two minor version of Sourcegraph, cherry-pick the changes into a patch branch and re-releases with a new patch version. 

For example, suppose we have the the recommended versions.

| Sourcegraph version | Recommended src-cli version |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | 
| `3.100`             | `3.90.5`                    |
| `3.99`              | `3.85.7`                    |

If a new feature is added to a new `3.91.6` release of src-cli and this change requires only features available in Sourcegraph `3.99`, then this feature should also be present in a new `3.85.8` release of src-cli. Because a Sourcegraph instance will automatically select the highest patch version, all non-breaking changes should increment only the patch version. 

Note that if instead the recommended src-cli version for Sourcegraph `3.99` was `3.90.4` in the example above, there is no additional step required, and the new patch version of src-cli will be available to both Sourcegraph versions.

## AppVeyor builds

We use AppVeyor to test `src-cli` on Windows.

Configure the AppVeyor builds by editing the `appveyor.yml` file and logging in to AppVeyor and changing the settings there.

Login with your GitHub account, switch to the `sourcegraph` account and change the settings here: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sourcegraph/src-cli/settings/environment
