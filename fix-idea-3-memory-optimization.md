# Fix Idea 3: Memory Management and Optimization

## Problem
With large batch specs containing thousands of changesets, the system may experience memory pressure, resulting in edits being dropped due to out-of-memory conditions or aggressive garbage collection cycles.

## Proposed Solution
Improve memory management and implement batch processing optimizations:

1. Implement chunking for very large batch specs, processing them in smaller groups
2. Add memory usage monitoring during batch processing to detect potential issues
3. Review all large data structures and optimize for memory efficiency
4. Consider streaming approaches for diff handling rather than loading everything into memory
5. Implement configurable limits for batch size with clear error messages when exceeded

## Implementation Areas
- `cmd/src/batch_common.go`: Add chunking logic for large batch specs
- `internal/batches/executor/run_steps.go`: Optimize memory use in diff handling
- Consider adding a memory profiling option for batch operations to identify bottlenecks

## Expected Outcome
The system should handle large batch specs efficiently without running into memory issues that could cause edits to be silently dropped. Any memory-related limitations should result in clear error messages rather than silent failures.
